# Shifted CMC

In the SCMC, the factorization model is different from the previous ones.

$$
\begin{align}
& F = ||P_\Omega (X - UV^\top Z)||_F^2
\\
& R = \alpha_1 || U ||_F^2 + \alpha_2 || V ||_F^2 + \alpha_3 || CRV ||_F^2
\end{align}
$$

Three versions of basic profile shifting are implemented: discrete-time shifts, continous-time shifts based on Fourier transformation and ...
